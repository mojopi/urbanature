Friendships can accrete around dancing, writing poetry, or sharing quotes. Similarly, shared references from the natural world can change be touchstones (eg. like secretes or inside jokes) for frienships and mediums for creative expression. Creatively re-expressing these references can allow someone to express themselves and connect with someone they care about. And, in the same way that the learning to hear patterns in music can change the way that you hear the world, learning to see something in the natural world can change the way what and how you pay attentino to the world and how much wonder you feel throughout your day.

For instance, in the spring, I made a new friend by walking and talking together. He shared ideas. I pointed out things that I saw in the world â€” seed pods, fruits, flowers, the sky. Because he enjoyed my enthusiasm for other living things, my love of the natural world had a new place to play and express itself. I started sending him photographs of plants we had seen on walks. Then, I began to take take photographs of plants, animals, and scenes when I went on jogs. As I went on my daily jog, I photographed more, I shared more and over time I began to see much more. More patterns, more textures, more colors, more themes, more individual organisms living their lives.
