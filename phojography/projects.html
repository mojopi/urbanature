    In the spring, I made a friend by walking and talking together. On walks, I pointed out things that I saw in the world — seed pods, fruits, flowers, the sky. Because my friend appreciated my enthusiasm for the natural world, my love of nature had a new place to express itself. I started texting photographs of plants we had seen on walks on my daily jog.As I photographed more and shared more, I began to see  more — patterns, textures, phenomena, specific species and how they developed over time...

   Hearing patterns in music, feeling something, and re-expressing that feeling by playing music can change the way that you  pay attention in the world. Similarly,  seeing patterns and species in the natural world and re-expressing the feeling them can change the way you see and experience the world.  The feeling evoked by references you see can be re-expressed in creative ways and shared as touchstones (like secretes or inside jokes) in frienships. </p>

    Each photograph below represents something I began to see as a result of the habits I cultivated in a friendship. Each photograph is a link.
