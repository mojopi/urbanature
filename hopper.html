<span id="h2">In school. In life.</span><br><br>

<p>I have always been drawn to many animals and young people and it's because they are shear life. Lightning in bodies. Spend time with a very young person, and it can feel like convening with another species in a piercing way. And young people often laugh louder, cry harder, gasp in awe more frequently than adults. Their wonder, compassion, and immersion in the world is reflective of a  freshness, fiercenss, and zest. In adults, this has often been eroded by norms and economic incentives that shape our patterns of behavior. <br><br>

Because of their zest, I think young people are particuarly good at seeing old things in new ways and making things that reflect their closeness and empathy with the world. There are many big things that reflect this reality such as the 60s, hip hop, the American Revolution. They were made by young(ish) people. With creative room, pre-teens and single-digit-aged people could also leverage their ways of knowing to make beautiful things. But instead, they're in school. And schools is about internalizing "adult" forms. Not expressing the ones inside young people.<br><br>

To highlight the beautiful expressions of zest, awe, wonder, creation that (young) people bring to seeing and making old htings in new ways, I want to follow around individuals and document them making things in life and making things in school. Through the juxtaposition of these photographs, I hope to hilight the deadening processes of close ways of knowing and making things in the world.<br><br>

This project idea is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration">Farm Security Administration's</a> photography project which made human and visible the nature of rural poverty during the depression, serving as an affective primer for policy changes that in the form of The New Deal. Analogously, you could imagine policies that could increase the biodiversity of contexts in which young people could do real, creative work. This project is meant to start witn young people and the rich ways of knowing and expressing that they bring. Starting from here, rather than the strucuture of school, will serve as a jumping off point to ask questions about the kinds of contexts where high quality human development  happens. The contexts in which young people are doing meaningful, creative work that is hard for them. The contexts in which young people are having authentic realtionships with each other and adults. <br><br> </p>

<span id="h3">When it comes to representation and documentation of natural world, what is your taste? What forms of storytelling do you resonate with? What does quality mean to you?</span>
<br><br>
<p>
Every month I want to advertise offer a day-long workshop for young people and/or families in Somerville. The workshop will start with a showing a "wildlife" film (eg. An episode of BBC Natural History Unit's <italic>Life, Blue Planet, Planet Earth</italic>, etc.) or a share-out from someone who is representing the natural world in "unorthodox ways" (eg. <a href="http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/>Nervous System"</a>, <a href="http://www.xavibou.com/index.php/project/ornitographies/">Ornitographies</a>). After the film or shareout, young people and adults will go out into the world play with a particular technique to make something. For instance you could imagine folks going outside to photograph different leaf patterns, using slow motion to capture a bee eating nectar, creating a timelapse vide of an ant colony, finding particulary patterns in a leaf outside and then using differen tools to represent that pattern in new ways digitally (eg. creating an algorithm in  to draw leaf vens) or physically (eg. using C+C machines to cut out a version of the pattern in wood). 
<br><br>

This project will hopefully be useful as people get to know their and cultivate perspective around taste, production quality, the expressive tools well-matched to how they want to express their intersts, the kinds of storytelling that resonate with them. </p>

I want to create an SMS-to-web tool that leads to crowd-sourced documentation and representation of the natural world in Somerville. I will post prompts and a description of the project [surreptitiously and serendepitiously, eg. above the door at a restuarant, in a few pews at a church, etc.]  around the city. I could imagine these prompts focusing on taking pictures of certain textures, patterns, shapes, gestures, actions etc. Folks who are so inspired (who take photos and texting them to the number) will have their photographs automatically posted on a website in a gallery style similar to the one organizing my "phojography." Not only will galleries be organized by prompt, they will also be organized by person. For instance, if a young person texts >10 "high quality" images, a gallery of their work will be generated and every time they text the photo, it will be uploaded. Very easily and quickly, young people will be able to have and contribute to a website of their work that sits amongst many other personal sites of adults and young people. </p>
