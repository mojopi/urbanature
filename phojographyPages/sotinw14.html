<span id="h1">milkweeds</span> <br><br>


<p>My recent interest in milkweeds began when I was walking with a friend and stopped to break open one of their seed pods. Throughout the fall and the winter, these pods turn from green to brown. They cracked open and a feathery blob of seeds buckled out. They gradually dispersed. I love the grainy texture of their brown seeds, the shiny-ness of their seed "parachutes," and the plant's latexy "milk" (it oozes out if you scratch a leaf or break off a branch. It's like white blood.). <br><br> Monarch caterpillars eat this "milk" from the leaves and it makes them taste bad to birds. Monarch butterflies eat the nectar from the flowers of the same plant. The relationship between milkweeds and butterflies challenges my conception of what a "self" or "individual" is. I find it very beauiful.

         <a href="./milkweedFlowers/milkweedflowers.html"><span style="color:blue">Here</span></a> are some photographs of milkweeds in the flower stage before several of those flowers develop into seed pods.
