<span id="h1">milkweeds</span> <br><br>


<p>I used to notice milkweeds near the beach I used to go to when I was a child. My recent interest in them began when I was walking with a friend. When I saw their pods, I stoped and broke it open to reveal the silky seeds. Since that walk, I've been taking photographs of their pods whenever I notice them. I began to notice how they crack open and how their seeds buckle out as a feathery blob and  gradually disperse throughout the fall and winter. I've fallen in love with the grainy texture of their actual seeds with the thin outer edge and the bulged inner disk. I love the whitish-blue shiny-ness of the seeds "parachutes. How their pods have this "prehistoric"-looking morphology(to me it looks a bit like 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziapelta">this</a> 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelenota_ananas">this</a>).  

        <br><br>

        I love the way  they ooze their latexy milk when you scratch a leaf or break off a pod. It's as if they have luminously white blood. I find this "glowing" liquid aesthetically beautiful and I think that it relates to a beatiful idea idea (it if the food source for monarch caterpillars and because of the way it accumulates in the caterpillar's body, it makes them taste bitter and acts as a defense against predators). While monarch caterpillars eat this liquid from the leaves, monarch butterflies eat the nectar from the flowers of the same plant. That relationship, the symmetry in development and timing, closeness of their survival and integratedness of their bodies... it challenges my conception of what a "self" or "individual" is. 

        <br><br>
        In reading about their development and relationships with various insects, I realized that I <a href="./milkweedFlowers/milkweedflowers.html">these flowers</a> I had been drawn to and taken pictures of were actually also milkweed plants. They were just in a different stage of their development! Suddenly I began to see something about the pods that I hadn't actually <italic>seen</italic> before! The brown, crispy strings I had seen around the seed pods were those pink flowers after they had died and dried. The "bottom" of a few flowers had given rise to the seed pods I loved!
