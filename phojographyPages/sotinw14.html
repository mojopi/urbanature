<span id="h1">milkweeds</span> <br><br>


<p>My recent interest in milkweeds began when I was walking with a friend. I stopped to break open one of their pods to show him  the silky seeds. Throughout the fall and the winter, the pods' green turns to brown. They crack open and how their seeds buckle out as a feathery blob. They gradually disperse. I've fallen in love with the grainy texture of their brown seeds, with the thin outer edge, and the bulged inner disk. I love the shiny-ness of their seeds "parachutes" and the texture of their seed cases. I love the way  they ooze their latexy milk when you scratch a leaf or break off a branch. It's as if they have white blood. Monarch caterpillars eat this liquid from the leaves and monarch butterflies eat the nectar from the flowers of the same plant. That relationship, the symmetry in development and timing between milkweed and monarchs, closeness of their survival and integrated-ness of their bodies... it challenges my conception of what a "self" or "individual" is. I find it very beauiful

        <br><br>
        In reading about their development and relationships with various insects, I realized that some <a href="./milkweedFlowers/milkweedflowers.html">flowers</a> I had been drawn to and had taken pictures of were  also milkweed plants, just in an earlier stage of development. Suddenly I began to see something about the pods that I hadn't actually <italic>seen</italic> before! The brown, crispy strings I had seen around the seed pods were pink flowers after they had died and dried and the "bottom" of a few pink flowers had given rise to the giant seed pods.
