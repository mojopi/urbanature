<span id="h1">milkweeds</span> <br><br>


<p>My recent interest in milkweeds began when I was walking with a friend and stopped to break open one of their seed pods. Throughout the fall and the winter, these pods turned from green to brown, cracked open, and feathery blobs of seeds buckled out. The seeds gradually dispersed. If you break a leaf or stem, the plant's latexy "milk" oozes out. It's like white blood. <br><br> Monarch caterpillars eat this "milk" from the leaves and it makes them taste bad to birds. Monarch butterflies eat the nectar from the flowers of the same plant. <br><br>This relationship between milkweeds and monarch butterflies challenges my notion of what an individual organism is. I find it very beautiful.
