<span id="h1">iphone macrophotography</span><br><br>
I bought a macro lens  for my iphone and went to Mt. Auburn Cemetary to try it out. Here are the things I learned and the prompts I generated.</p>

<span id="h2">Things I learned: </span>
<br>
<p>
1. I move and plants move...constantly. Use a hard surface (eg. a gravestone or tree) to lean on. Or, sit on the ground and lean arms on crossed legs to take a photograph of something below the camera. This is much easier than taking a photo of something at  eye level where you don't have anything to lean on.<br> Macrophotography with an iphone is more like yoga than I thought. <br><br>
2. I can use myself as a tripod. I sat on a rock balanced my head on a wet log I found to take pictures of frogs in a pond. 
<br><br>
3. The depth of field on my iphone is very limited and the amount of an organism that I can actually capture in a focused way is...not much.
