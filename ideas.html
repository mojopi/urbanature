        Get grey tempera paint and paint shadows on the ground. By the time I'm finished painting, the shadow will have moved, but the point is getting better at seeing, at looking.
        <br> In this case, I'll start to see shadows in a new way.

        <p> Make bird feeders, houses, and baths out of found stuff (eg. telephone pole insulation). Study a place and get to know the birds. Know what type of food to buy and what placement is best (given how shy the birds (ie. who your audience is).

        <p> Walk dogs and get to know them without seeing them as cute. Journal about them. Draw them. Observe them. Learn how to "be in the same play" as them. If they're cowring in corner, what do you do? how do you act? If they're barking and nipping, what feeling do you project?</p>

        <p> Build nests. Observe all different kinds of bird's nests, animal, and human shelters. Study them. Draw them. Read about them. Pitch ideas. Build some shelters and as a group go camping with YPs with their shelters.

        <p> When starting to sketch and watercolor with YPs, only use a small (fits in hand) sketchbook to limit your frame and to make sure that you focus on a small area and really see the details. Similarly, when working with flowers start with macro flowers like zuchinni flowers (they are particularly good), not compound flowers like lilacs because even though you want to focus on detail, you want to get the gist and the form of the thing and not keep everything tight and small.

        Idea for program!<br>
        Frame: From nothing to something <br><br>

        What: Explore biology as an accretionary process and an art. 

        <br><br>Experiencing developmental and ecological processes through observation and documentaiton where the documentation is also an accretionary process that's "from nothing to something."
        <br>
        <br>
        Next steps: <br> What are the resources I'm using to draw from, tools, prompts, processes we're exploring?

        Random [vague and bad] evocative examples for now:<br>
        You could imagine filling a canvas a certain way with multiple people doing different, consistent things with paint splatters.
        <br>
        <br> 

        You could imagine creating something that drips water in a certain way mimicking an ecological process via analogy.
       <br>
       <br>
       You could imagine doing timelapses.
        <br>
       <br>
       You could imagine doing cyanotyping, using natural processes themselves (eg. fermentation), using motion (ceramics) to capture certain natural processes (eg. capturing forms of hands or leaves or bacteria on hands on leaves)
       <br>
       <br>
        You could imagine watching processes over time: drawing a bird or amphibian egg or flower each day
