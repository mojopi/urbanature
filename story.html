When I was four and had lice, I refused to kill them with shampoo. As my mom washed my hair, I screamed that we could keep them as pets. By that point, I had already discovered  that lambchops came from lambs declared that I would never eat animals again. Instead I ate  pasta. Vegetarianism sat along side  picking up trash on the streets, selling t-shirts to save the rainforest, going to the park and stopping everyone with a dog. I've noticed that this reluctant-industrialist impulse is very common in young people because they are often more sensitive to living within systems with suicidal definitions of progress. They want to live with the world instead. Captain Planet, Fernwood Gully, Disney's Pocahantas appeal to this impulse.  

And for quite a while, little changed. In high school I trained dolphins, I worked at a vet's office, I voluteered at an animal shelter. In  college I trained seals, studied vertebrate evolution and marine ecology, and planned on becoming a vet or a marine mammologist. After several existential crises about not wanting to do marine research... I acknowledged to myself that a) I get sea sick b) I didn't want to study nature. I wanted something else.

In college, as a teaching assistant for a vertebrate evolution course, I fell in love with  the magic that comes from connecting with other people around life's beautiful forms and deep ideas. Looking at an echidna's pelvic bones, comparing the jaws of sheep and hyenas,  revealing the homologous forms of a whale's fin a human hand...it was electricity. Sharing this with other people felt like my version of what I project that some spiritual people feel about spreading the gospel. And so instead of becoming a a marine biologist or a vet like I had planned...I got a job as a middle and high school science teacher and spent six years feeling blessed while getting to know, laughing, and feeling joy and wonder with young people as we expored  a buffet of forms/ideas inspired by the "natural world." Around and within my students and I accreted the stuff of deep friendships. We co-constructed shared references, shared jokes, shared analogies. It felt like such a gift meaningful relationships with such alive people who, on some level, explored the natural world with me. But science class is still science class. It is still coercive (ie.  young people don't choose to be in school) and by virtue of it being science class, I was still "pushing" my (ie. the curriculum's) interests instead of giving young people the space and the tools to genuinely express theirs.



However, I think the platonic form of the thing at the heart of this is having relationships with yourself and other people around the shared wonder of being embedded in the natural world.

 This is the seed around which my research Agenda is to crystalize my research agenda.
