<p id=h1>Photography</p>

<p>You could imagine focusing on different themes and prompts (eg. textures, colors, species, portraiture) and creating a book or a digital gallery of the different photographs you take. </p>

<br>

<p>Click the link below to see some  photographs that I've taken with my iphone on jogs in Cambridge and New York City over the past year. Recently, I organized them into themes to  communicate the way I see plants and animals in the world. Click on each photo and it reveals photographs of that 'theme.' 

<br>
Because I often text photos like these two a friend, I used the photos I texted to him to make a book, which I gave as a gift for Christmas. You could imagine making prints, books, childrens stories, print cards, digital cards using your photographs</p>
