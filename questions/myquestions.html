        <span id="h3">Question:</span> I was watching the honeylocust tree. A chickadee flew from from moss patch to moss patch and pecked the each one. Was it eating something in the moss? Is there some symbiotic relationship between tree, moss, an insect species, and chickadee?</p>

        <!-- First off, until I started reading Wikipedia, I didn't know that the bushy bundles growing on this tree were lichen (in addition to the flat aqua-green patches). I thought they were moss (a non-vascular plant). Lichen is a composite between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria. The bushy ones I noticed are referred to as "fruticose" and the flat ones are referred to as "foliose" (it's a morphological difference)... -->

Climb the tree and inspects for insects (or marks) on the lichen to better understand this behavior. It could be that they're eating something on the bark or beneath the bark that's unrelated to the lichen because I've seen them peck lichen-less bark so need to look at their peck prints.

    <p><span id="h3">Question:</span> I saw a mushroom that was appx 4" across. It had an pattern of holes on its top and looked like Moroccan architecutre. A few feet down the road I saw another mushroom that was erupting from the ground. Small piles of sandy soil were sitting on its surface.
        <br> Does the placement of soil on the mushroom's surface cause it to develop those pattern of holes? Also, there was a hole in the ground near the mushroom. Is there some relationship between hole-dwelling creatures (who lives there - rodents?) and mushrooms?

            <span id="h3">Question:</span>One of the ways that you can tell queen Anne's Lace (QAL)from hemlock is because some QAL flowers have a dark red spot in the middle (which is supposedly Queen Anne's blood from when she pricked herself making the lace). What funciton does this spot serve? Why do some flowers have it and other's don't. Why invest the energy on making the pigment? One one flower with the spot had ants crawling on it. Are insects attracted to this spot?

            <span id="h3">Question:</span> While climbing a tree and feeling the cracks of its bark on the soles of my feet, I realized that the cracks break in such a way that looks as if they crack in response to how the plant grew. Are cracks in a bark kind of like stretch marks on our skin? They happen because of the force of growth?

            Why do ferns have many little leaves? Since they grow near the ground, wouldn't it be more beneficial to have full leaves? Wouldn't they catch more sunlight that way? And since they're low they don't need to avoid much wind stress, right? What's up with this?
