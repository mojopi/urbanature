Mission:
To cultivate habits and ways of seeing that foster softer, more whole relationships, ways of knowing  (eg. knowing a person vs knowing a fact), and creative forms of expression amongst people and the natural world. People will cultivate new ways of seeing and knowing themselves, each other, and the natural world through  immersive experiences where they spend quality time together observing nature and creatively expressing what they see in service to something or someone that is meaningful to them.
