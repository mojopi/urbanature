<span id="h1">scan + cyan</span>
<p>
	You could imagine using various tools and materials to see plants and animals in new ways. Recently, I got a flatbed scanner and have been scanning different types of flowers, leaves, and seeds to make high resolution images. The scanner allows me to capture a perspective that I would never be able to secure with a traditional camera. <br><br> You could imagine using this tool to make, interactive, digital stories with images of seaweed, a photography book about feathers, grasses, or the small flowers we rarely notice, a stationary line with images of local plants on the front and small descriptions on the back, etc. <br><br>

	The idea of scanning plants was inspired by this beautiful book about seaweed called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I53DMEA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">The Ocean Garden</a>. Seaweed seems like a particularly good medium to scan because it is flat and transparent. I've found that flat plant and anima parts (eg. ferns leaves, grass flowers, feathers) are also well-suited to this tool.

	<br><br>

	I've also started to make cyanotypes (blue prints where that use chemical reactions with UV light). I'm particularly excited about making prints (or maybe a book) of entire plants and root systems this way.
