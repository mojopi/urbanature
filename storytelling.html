<span id="h1">Stories</span>

<br><br>

<p>
	My family speaks in stories. Where I come from, everything, even the small stuff (eg. a trip to the pharmacy, running into someone at the prepared food counter at <a href="http://www.zabars.com/">Zabars</a>, a mistakenly-bought, ugly dress...) is a story. Coming from this world, I intuited that all families communicated this way. However, that's obvioulsy not true. I have many friends whose families don't speak in stories and instead have other ways of knowing each other often based more in shared experience. Their conversation often seems more present, less historical, and less  rooted in narrative artifacts that reveal how people think about their development and relationships. 
	<br><br>

	Since I grew up swimming in stories, this form has colored my relationship to all kinds of ideas. In college, while taking a required calculus course, I  sat alone for days translating the ideas and equations into stories. Once I started doing this, I loved the ideas. Similarly, learning about evolution changed the way experience the world. As an idea, evolution is the ultimate story-seer. It brings to life seemingly static forms (eg. bones, skin, seed pods, etc.). Evolutionary ideas are incredible to see and think with when it comes to hypothesizing about the origin stories of...almost everything. For instance, looking at a horse hoof and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_horse">constructing stories</a> (some based on observation and some not) about why it is the way it is, reveals so much about the form <italic>(and</italic> so much about us). Good storytelling that link forms to the ideas that shaped them is one of the reasons why I loved learning about the natural world "with" David Attenborough. His <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2hvrt5">mammal</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/75555419">plant</a> series are particulalry good when it comes to telling the stories of nature's forms. 
	<br><br>

	I think that storymaking and storytelling is a way of knowing that is often close, soft, connected, emotionally resonant, and well- matched to representing sequences of experiences that happen in time.  For me, seeing and making stories based on observations <italic>feels</italic> much more being in friendship than learning a fact. 
	<br><br>

	Because of the way stories-making can narrow the distance between observer and subject and creates a more relational dyanic between people and phenomena, I want to use storytelling and observations to know ecological and evolutionary processes in a <a href="http://www.papert.org/articles/EpistemologicalPluralism.html">closer, softer</a> way. 
	<br><br>


	I'm currently doing projects to cultivate and deepen my own relationship to the natural world through whole, close observation and documentation over time. I'm also thinking about what activities, resources, experiences and tools will help me (and other folks) package up materials (photographs, sketches, videos, etc.) to tell stories. These "packaging up" tools are not meant to "just" add a level of polish and organization to raw observation. For me, representing my observations into bigger wholes has helped me generate new questions, see themes in what I'm drawn to, see limitations in what I'm doing, and leaves me feeling energized to cultivate new habits that will allow me to see more and tell more stories.

	<span id="h3"><a href="galleryMaker.html">Square Quilt</a></span>
	<br><br>


	<p>Curating a body of work into coherent themes or ideas is a form of storytelling. In "curating" my phojography, I began to see themes, questions, and things that resonated with me (ie. milkweeds) that I hadn't previously explicitly acknowledged to myself. <br><br>

	This code snippet generates a preformated quilt of squares/ a "gallery"  that you can fill in with your own stuff and can add your own title and description.</p>

		<br><br>

		<p>This is the first draft of a story I began making based on <a href="./phojographyPages/sotinw14.html">my affinity</a> for milkweed plants. I was excited about incorporating drawings and my photographs into something that felt more alive and less stagnant than still photographs. I think this story doesn't yet capture the feeling of interconnection, development, and dispersal that I want to communicate. I need to do a lot more observation and research before I can capture this feeling. As a tool, separate from the specific story, I don't think that it's particularly versatile with regard to people bringing their own tastes and intersts to it to create expressive, divergent work that is meaningful (and exciting) for them. I'm not sure why it's different from a slideshow application at this point...but will continue to develop it. 
<br><br>

		The way it currently works is that if you click on the the butterfly it goes to the next scene in the story. If you click on the caterpillar, it goes to the previous scene.
