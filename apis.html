<span id="h1">API Projects</h1>
<br>
<p>What are different ways to respresent large-scale natural phenomena that <italic> feels</italic> closer, connected to our lives and more expressive than explanations based on facts and explanations that we learn in a ways that is disconnected from our experience? In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0wk4qG2mIg">this documentary</a> which documents the misconcetions that MIT and Harvard graduates have about why the seasons happen, to me the point is not that even people at those high up places are ignorant, but rather that the current form of Schooling through information transmission doesn't work. It separates facts from experience and breaks up phenomena into bits and pieces that cannot be put together in a coherent whole. The intention of the projects described here is not to "teach" anything about the natural world. They are meant to offere evocative examples and tools that people can use to express their own ways of knowing, relationships, and relationships with themselves, each other, and the natural world. This particular project (with APIs) is meant to be a handle through which people can find expresive ways to interact with large-scale natural phenomena (eg. the moon's phase changes) and relate them to their everyday lives. <br><br>


<span id="h2">Moon Project #1</span><br><br>
My friend and I both love the moon. We text each other a moon emoji when we are struck by it's presence in the sky. In general, I love my texting conversations with this friend because our conversations are often about the world -  what we see and ideas we find beautiful and care about. To represent this aspect of our relationship and our shared admiration of the moon, I used the <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/">Weather Underground API</a> and the data it streams about the moon phase to make my friend a <a href="./moonProject/moon2.html">gift</a>. I took photographs of our text messages on different days and put the name of the photograph's file, the date, and the moon phase into a list. A star is created for each text conversation on the image of a phone I drew in <a href="https://www.fiftythree.com/">paper</a>. <br><br>

Now, when I'm struck by the moon, I sometimes visit the site, click on the stars, and revisit past conversations we had on other days when the moon was this phase. It feels totally surredipitous and I come across conversations I haven't thought of in quite a while. The conversations that show up in the stars are based on the moon's phase and while this nothing to do with science, representing this aspect of my friendhship in this way has changed my relationship to the moon, memories, and has been generative for thinking about how to represent and connect beautiful artifacts from relationships with beautiful phenomena in the world. </p>

 <p id="note">Note: Because I didn't want to share with the world all of the text message conversations I had with my friend, for the sake of the website here, I have "just" put in the code two different text-message conversatons. Thus, the project here is an inauthentic represntation of what I made for my friend (which has hundreds of text message conversations which can only  be understood within the context of our friendship, anyway :).</p>
