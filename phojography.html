     On my daily jog, I started taking and texting photographs of plants and animals to a friend. As I photographed more and shared more, I saw more patterns, textures, specific species and how they developed over time... 


</p>

<p>
    Each photograph below represents something I began to see as a result of the habits I cultivated while taking photographs. Click on each image  to see the "pattern" it represents.

    This project isn't finished. I hope it'll never be and will continue to accrete as I get better at seeing old things in new ways.;)
