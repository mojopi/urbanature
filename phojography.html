    In the spring, I made a friend by walking and talking together. On walks, I pointed out things that I saw in the world (eg. seed pods, fruits, flowers, the sky). Like someone with an odd sense of humor coming across a friend who appreciates their jokes, my enthusiasm for the natural world had a new place to express itself...in this friendship. On my daily jog, I started taking and texting photographs of plants we had seen together. As I photographed more and shared more, I saw more â€” patterns, textures, phenomena, specific species and how they developed over time...

   Hearing motifs in music, feeling something, and re-expressing that feeling in making music or dance... itcan change the way that you listen and pay attention. Similarly,  seeing phenomena/species and re-expressing the feeling they evoke in you can change the way you see and experience the world (especially if those creative expressions have a social place to live like in a friendship or community). </p>

    Each photograph below represents something I began to see as a result of the habits I cultivated in my friendship. Each one is linked to another page.
