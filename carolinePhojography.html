    In the spring, I began walking with a friend and pointing out things that I saw in the world (eg. seed pods, fruits, flowers, the sky). On my daily jog, I started taking and texting photographs of plants we had seen together. As I photographed more and shared more, I saw more patterns, textures, specific species and how they developed over time...

    Each photograph below represents something I began to see as a result of the habits I cultivated while jogging. Click on each image below to see the "theme" that that image represents.
